These are sketches for a collaborative editor closely following
suggestions taken from the paper "Real time group editors without
Operational transformation" by Oster, Urso, Molli and Imine.

Using the JSHash module, it is possible to use a Javascript array as a 
typed hash in Haskell.

As of now, entered characters are passed from editor to editor, as 
an Integer representing their Unicode. Deletion is not implemented yet.
